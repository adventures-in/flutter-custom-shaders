- created creation.spv with [chriscraws/dart-shader: dart expressions that can be exported as spir-v](https://github.com/chriscraws/dart-shader)
- grabbed the example code from [CustomPaint](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/CustomPaint-class.html) and [CustomPainter](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/CustomPainter-class.html)
- swapped out the gradient shader with a shader created with creation.spv
